Tobias's Object Oriented Programming Library.
The point of this library is to make a point.

Object Oriented Programming is fun and satisfying. This library aims to wrap everything in JS into classes that can be utilized in dependency injection systems or directly be used. It is implemented in Typescript but can be used just as good in pure javascript.

This Library follows a very specific philosophy: OOP has to answer the question what there was first, the Chicken or the Egg. And the answer is of course the abstract `ChickenFactoryBuilderConstructorInitialisorConfigurationManager` interface.
